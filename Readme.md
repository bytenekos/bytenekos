# Hi there (I guess...)

---

### I'm ByteNeko! You can call me Byte or Neko.
#### Currently I'm learning Swift and SwiftUI

Work on the [Elaina](https://github.com/bytenekos/elaina) repo has been put on hold for now as I've gotten burned out from working on it.
I do plan on returning to it some day in the future though<br>
If you want to send in PRs then feel free!

### Want to contact me about *literally* anything? Send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@byteneko.dev">contact@byteneko.dev</a> as I'm not too active on social media these days, I don't bite! :D
